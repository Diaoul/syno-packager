The files required for the broken links can be obtained from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dsgpl/files/

If you don't find the required files there, please check the support
section at www.synology.com or try their forums.

For x86, use the tool chain released for DSM 2.3. The earlier ones don't
work due to missing libraries.
